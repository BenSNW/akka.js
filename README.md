# Actor system for Scala.js

This project aims at providing an actor system for Scala.js, featuring at least:

*   Supervision
*   (Almost) transparent collaboration with actors in an Akka-based backend
*   If time permits: dispatch actors in several web workers

This project is in the initial development stage. There is nothing working yet.
